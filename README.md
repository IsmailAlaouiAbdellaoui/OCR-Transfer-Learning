# OCR-Transfer-Learning
This is a pet project I decided to tackle. Can we build a reliable OCR model using transfer learning ?

I am using keras and CNNs to find the best way to solve OCR issues.

The purpose here is to try to recognize uppercase letters inside an image.
Here is a prototype of the images used : 
![alt tag](https://github.com/IsmailAlaouiAbdellaoui/OCR-Transfer-Learning/blob/master/FIZEBGPMKUPNVFBR.png)

Font used : Arial
Keras version : 2.1.2
tensorflow version : 1.3.0
opencv version : 3.4.1


The following images are created in the "Training", "Testing", and "Validation" folders.
* 10000 training images.
* 2250 testing images.
* 250 validation images.


To do :
Use the following models :
* Densenet
* Resenet
* Mobilenet

Instructions for starting the program are coming soon.
